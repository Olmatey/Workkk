Final comment:
I would like to thank you again. I am a raw developer and would consider myself at a junior level that strives for perfection.
I went out of my way and created a landing page and drinks page. I used html and react best practises to create this site.

PROS
Included responsive and multi-platform support to enable the site to be viewed on any platform and device
Utilised debugging best practises using Google Chrome inspect element tooling
Created functional filter menu and search bar.


CONS:
I will be completely honest, I did have issues with the testing with jest. I feel as i need to see a crash course on how to properly test components or see someone do it first hand
